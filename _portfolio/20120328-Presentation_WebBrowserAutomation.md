Abstract
-------

Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin that sends commands to the browser according to the instructions contained in user-defined scripts. This Tech Talk will cover the basics of Selenium IDE, present examples of how the Digital Projects Newspaper Group is using Selenium to streamline the process of editing metadata records in The Portal to Texas History and UNT Digital Library, and provide resources for further inquiry. The Tech Talk will conclude with a demonstration of Selenium IDE including a suite of search scripts developed for the UNT Libraries.
