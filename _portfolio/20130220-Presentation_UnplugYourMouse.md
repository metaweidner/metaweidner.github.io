Abstract
-------

This Tech Talk presentation discusses workflow automation with AutoHotkey. AutoHotkey provides an easy to use scripting language for assigning multiple actions to a single key command, or hotkey. The AutoHotkey syntax also supports programming constructs and the creation of graphical user interfaces for developing complex applications. This Tech Talk will demonstrate how to write AutoHotkey scripts and give examples of how the Digital Projects Unit is using the software to streamline repetitive tasks.
