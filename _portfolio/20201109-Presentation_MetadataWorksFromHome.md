Abstract
-------

Faced with campus closures, a University of Houston Libraries team developed plans to engage student employees in creating closed captions for hundreds of archival videos on the Librariesâ€™ Audio/Video Repository. Panelists describe the project and address unique challenges related to transcribing archival content, including dated and offensive content.
