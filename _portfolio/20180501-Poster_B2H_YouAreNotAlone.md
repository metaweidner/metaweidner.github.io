Abstract
-------

The Bridge2Hyku (B2H) project, funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (LG-70-17-0217-17), will provide the digital archives community with a toolkit for content migration to the open source platform Hyku. The B2H Toolkit plan and outcomes aim to establish a framework for sustainable data migration. The project will leverage IMLS investment to build capacity for libraries and cultural heritage institutions in adoption of Hyku nationally and worldwide. As part of the deliverables for phase one, the project team at the University of Houston surveyed multiple institutions about their digital collections. The survey was designed to collect data related to, but not limited to: content types, metadata schema, digital collection production workflows, preservation considerations, stakeholder considerations, and more. The data analysis and final report from this survey identified migration needs for a broad range of digital repository environments. The poster will showcase statistics gleaned from the survey that highlight trends in the overall preparedness, or unpreparedness, of institutions transitioning their data in the digital space, particularly onto open source platforms. The poster will also provide information about future directions for B2H and information for institutions who are interested in getting involved in the B2H community.
