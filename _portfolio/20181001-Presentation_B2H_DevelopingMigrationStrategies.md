Abstract
-------

The University of Houston (UH) Libraries, in partnership and consultation with numerous institutions, was awarded an IMLS National Leadership/Project Grant (LG-70-17-0217-17) to support the creation of the Bridge2Hyku (B2H) Toolkit. Focusing on general information and guides for digital collections migration as well as on specific content for migrating to the Hyku platform, the toolkit will help institutions better understand their digital library ecosystems and how they can plan, prepare for, and conduct migrations. This two-year grant project is divided into three phases. Phase one of the project identified digital collections and system requirements needed for migration strategy and tool development. Phase two, currently in progress, is dedicated to the creation of the B2H website, migration tool development and documentation. Phase three is for assessment, improvement and promotion of the toolkit. This presentation will outline and discuss activities in these key phases and share the work completed to date.
