Abstract
-------

Authority control is essential for creating high quality, interoperable metadata. Reworking legacy data to bring it in line with recognized vocabularies is a time consuming process that presents many challenges. The Metadata Unit at the University of Houston (UH) Libraries has developed custom AutoHotkey applications that automate name and subject authority control workflows in the CONTENTdm Project Client for improved speed and accuracy during data entry. This presentation will provide a brief overview of the metadata upgrade process at UH and an in-depth look at the tools that automate the metadata enhancement process.
