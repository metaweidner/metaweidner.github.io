Abstract
-------

The University of Houston (UH) Libraries made an institutional commitment in late 2015 to migrate the data for its digitized cultural heritage collections to open source systems for preservation and access: Samvera, Archivematica, and ArchivesSpace. In order to ensure that preservation objects can be uniquely identified in Archivematica and referenced/accessed through the other systems, the UH Libraries implementation team has developed a "single SIP" data model in which a digital object's files and metadata are packaged individually prior to Archivematica ingest. The single SIP model provides flexibility in file management, avoids overloading Archivematica's processing capacity, and allows for direct persistent links from ArchivesSpace and Samvera to the preservation objects in Archivematica storage.
