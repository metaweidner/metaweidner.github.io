Abstract
-------

Juggling multiple time-sensitive projects can be challenging. Project managers must be able to see the short term details of work on specific projects and the long term time frames that facilitate effective prioritization. Project management software, such as [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), can help project managers prioritize tasks, organize documentation, delegate work, and track progress quickly and efficiently. This presentation will provide an overview of available project management software for various institutions and types of work and continue with an introduction to Basecamp's core features: To-Do Lists, Text Documents, Files, Discussions, and Events. The presentation will also include a demonstration of how the Metadata Unit at the University of Houston Libraries uses Basecamp to track production for the UH Digital Library.
