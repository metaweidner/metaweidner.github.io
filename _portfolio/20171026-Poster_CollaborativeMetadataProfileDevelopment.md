Abstract
-------

In 2015, after an extensive review process, the University of Houston (UH) Libraries chose the open source systems Hyku (then known as the Hydra-in-a-Box project), Archivematica, and ArchivesSpace to form the Librariesâ€™ digital collections access and preservation ecosystem. This suite of systems, along with locally developed tools, form the Bayou City Digital Asset Management System (BCDAMS). In 2016, the BCDAMS Implementation Team began work on a multi-phase process to roll out the new systems to replace the current digital collections management system, CONTENTdm. Phase I of this process included developing fundamental models and principles as well as much of the local infrastructure and workflows. Phase II of the project will involve migrating existing digital collection metadata and files to the new digital asset management system (DAMS). This poster summarizes work done during Phase I of the project to prepare for the migration work in Phase II. This included working collaboratively to develop a Metadata Application Profile (MAP) and crosswalk, and an analysis of metadata remediation required to prepare for migration. It shares the UH Libraries unique experience in preparing for the migration of UH Digital Library (UHDL) data from CONTENTdm to a new system and offers some general considerations for DAMS migrations.
