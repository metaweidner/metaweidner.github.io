Abstract
-------

Maintaining usable and sustainable digital collections requires a complex set of actions that address the myriad challenges at various stages of the data lifecycle. Digital curation activities enhance access and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and facilitate use and re-use over time. Digital resource life cycle management is becoming an increasingly important topic as digital curators actively explore tools and applications that directly perform curation and management tasks. Accordingly, the University of North Texas (UNT) Libraries develop and/or adopt various tools, workflows, and quality control mechanisms that enable quick and effective analysis and quality assurance. This poster will demonstrate automated metadata enhancement with Selenium IDE, an open source, web-based tool which UNT has adopted for use during the post ingestion stage of the data lifecycle.
