Abstract
-------

Migrating digital collections to a new digital asset management system (DAMS) is a challenging process that often requires changes throughout a digital projects workflow. The University of Houston (UH) Libraries’ Digitization Operations (DO) unit is nearing completion of a multi-year effort to remodel our “Digitization House,” aligning workflows and outputs with an open source digitization and preservation tool, [Carpenters](https://github.com/uhlibraries-digital/carpenters), which was designed and built at UH Libraries for the Bayou City DAMS ecosystem.

This presentation reflects on the roots of the digital collections program at the University of Houston Libraries and how decisions made at the beginning have informed our remodeling plans today. We will discuss changes in imaging standards over the years of varied digital collections leadership and the steps that DO has taken to remediate imaging issues for migration to the Bayou City DAMS. These steps included a comprehensive analysis of our legacy images, the development of tooling to assess image quality, and reprocessing for high quality access derivatives.
