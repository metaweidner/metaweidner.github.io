Abstract
-------

Since 2009 the University of Houston Libraries have expanded access to the rare and special collections through the University of Houston Digital Library (UHDL). Five years and 50,000 digital items later, UHDL is a powerful resource for researchers of all kinds. Users rely on UHDL metadata to be robust, reliable, retrievable and sharable. Over time, metadata standards applied to the digital library have varied. In 2013, the Metadata & Digitization Services Department implemented a Metadata Upgrade Project to audit and upgrade the existing metadata produced for the UHDL. This presentation provides an update to the Metadata Upgrade Project and introduces automation tools recently implemented to streamline the work in the CONTENTdm Project Client. The presentation will offer suggestions to other institutions interested in conducting a metadata audit, particularly those institutions operating CONTENTdm.
