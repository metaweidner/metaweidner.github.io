Abstract
-------

In the Summer of 2014, the University of Houston Libraries formed the DAMS Task Force to identify a system that can support the growing expectations of the UH Digital Library. This presentation will focus on the two core activities that the task force completed: needs assessment and DAMS evaluation. The presentation will discuss how task force members compiled the results of the assessment, established DAMS evaluation criteria, and used the approach to select a new DAMS. It will also reflect on the important role that collaboration, project management, and strategic planning played in this team-based approach to DAMS selection.
