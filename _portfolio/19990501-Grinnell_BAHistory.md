My Role
-------

I earned a Bachelor's Degree in History from the Grinnell College History Department. I completed an independent study on the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland after a semester abroad at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) in Ireland, where I took courses in Irish Archaeology, Gaelic Language, Irish History, and Irish Literature.

Beyond the history degree, I immersed myself in a wide-ranging liberal arts and sciences course of study, including courses in:
* Calculus
* Coaching Methods
* Electronic Music
* Environmental Economics
* Piano Performance
* Philosophy of the Mind
* Psychology
* Shakespeare
* Stagecraft
