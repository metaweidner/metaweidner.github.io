Abstract
-------

The University of Houston (UH) Libraries recently completed the comprehensive evaluation and testing of multiple systems for digital asset management and preservation. In concurrent efforts, a Digital Asset Management Systems Task Force (DAMSTF) and Digital Preservation Task Force (DPTF) selected open source solutions – Hydra and Archivematica, respectively – for the long term stewardship of the UH Libraries’ digital collections. Members of the DAMSTF and DPTF will provide an overview of the systems implementation process and discuss some of the challenges that the implementation team has faced along the way.
