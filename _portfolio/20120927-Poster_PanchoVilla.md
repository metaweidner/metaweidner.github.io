Abstract
-------

This poster discusses frontiers in digital newspapers. Since early 2011, the University of New Mexico and the University of North Texas have been engaged in a historical newspaper digitization project. The endeavor is part of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP): a long-term project coordinated by the Library of Congress with the goal of digitizing 100,000 pages of historical newspapers from each of the 50 states and publishing them to the Web at Chronicling America (chroniclingamerica.loc.gov). NDNP New Mexico is funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. After digitizing and creating metadata for approximately one hundred reels of microfilmed newspapers, New Mexico NDNP has completed its 100,000 page goal. Contemporary accounts of many noteworthy historical events in New Mexico history are now readily available online. One such event is General Francisco "Pancho" Villa's cross-border attack on Columbus, New Mexico, an important episode in the Border War spurred by the Mexican Revolution.
