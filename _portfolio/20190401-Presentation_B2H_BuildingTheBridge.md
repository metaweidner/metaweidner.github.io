Abstract
-------

The University of Houston Libraries, in partnership and consultation with numerous institutions, was awarded an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership/Project Grant to support the creation of the Bridge2Hyku (B2H) Toolkit. Content migration from proprietary systems to open source repositories remains a barrier for many institutions due to lack of tools, tutorials, and documentation. The B2H Toolkit, which includes migration strategies and use cases as well as tools for transitioning from CONTENTdm to Hyku, acts as a comprehensive resource to facilitate repository migration. Having reached key milestones, the presenters will showcase the toolkit and describe how it can help institutions complete digital collections migration efficiently. The presenters will also share collaborative strategies with partner institutions in this grant project, and they will discuss sustainability and promotion of the B2H toolkit.
