My Role
-------

I received a [Master's Degree in Library Science](https://informationscience.unt.edu/ms-majoring-library-science) from the UNT Department of Information Science. I entered the program intending to pursue a career as an archivist, but my focus quickly shifted to metadata and digital collections. I earned a [Graduate Academic Certificate in Digital Content Management](https://informationscience.unt.edu/digital-content-management) that had an early influence on the arc of my career in libraries.
