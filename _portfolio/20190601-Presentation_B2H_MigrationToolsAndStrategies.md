Abstract
-------

The University of Houston (UH) Libraries, in partnership and consultation with numerous institutions, was awarded an IMLS National Leadership/Project Grant to support the creation of the Bridge2Hyku (B2H) Toolkit. Contents migration from proprietary systems to open source repositories remains a barrier for many institutions due to lack of tools, tutorials, and documentation. The B2H Toolkit, which includes migration strategies and use cases as well as tools for transitioning from CONTENTdm to Hyku, acts as a comprehensive resource to facilitate the repository migration process.

This presentation will start with background information on the ecosystems, workflows, and tools, collectively known as the Bayou City Digital Asset Management System (BCDAMS), implemented at the UH Libraries. The presenters will then move to the key phases that make up the IMLS funded B2H Toolkit project plan. The presenters will also discuss how the project engages and strengthens the open source Samvera Community (formerly Hydra Community) around Hyku by leveraging our collective expertise through strategic collaboration. They will finally discuss sustainability and promotion of the B2H toolkit.
