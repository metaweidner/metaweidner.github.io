Abstract
-------

Migration of digital objects from one digital asset management system to another creates an opportunity to clean and standardize descriptive metadata through automated analysis and remediation. This presentation will discuss how the University of Houston Libraries developed scripts that programmatically access the data in the UH Digital Library through the existing digital asset management systemâ€™s application programming interface (API), reports used to identify and correct problems, and plans for publishing UHDL data as linked data.
