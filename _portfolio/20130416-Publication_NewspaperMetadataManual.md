Abstract
-------

This document describes the process that the University of North Texas (UNT) Libraries' Digital Newspaper Unit (DNU) uses to create metadata for the scanned newspapers published on The Portal to Texas History as part of the Texas Digital Newspaper Program (TDNP). High quality metadata helps users find what they want more quickly. Over time, accurate descriptive metadata fosters trust among the Portal's user community.
